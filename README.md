# Iris Dataset prediction using decision tree
 A project that applies the Decision Tree algorithm to classify the Iris dataset.
 
# Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of the Decision Tree algorithm to classify the Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics, consisting of 150 samples of iris flowers, each described by four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Features
Classification of iris flowers using Decision Tree,
Evaluation of model performance,
Visualization of results
